Surface plays a key role in helping Microsoft achieve these goals, so we are working to\nreduce the environmental impacts of our Surface products. Our approach embeds\nsustainability into the design, manufacturing, distribution, use, and end-of-life management\nof our devices. We will continue to innovate to meet our targets and we will share our\nprogress along the way.\n\n![img-1-2](img-1-2)\n\nWe need to act quickly to meet our 2030 goals.

That's because quantifying the \nenvironmental impacts of our products is critical to make and \ntrack progress toward our carbon reduction goal. We use LCA \nto identify and prioritize opportunities to minimize the carbon \nfootprint across the full life cycle of our devices. We'll continue \nto learn from this work and apply new insights to each product \nwe design, make, and ship to customers.\n\nThe life cycle assessment2 of Surface Hub 3 and Surface Hub 2S\nincludes production of one device, distribution to customer, 5\nyears of product use3, and end-of-life management. The\nestimated annual electricity consumption4 in use is 715 kWh per\nyear for Surface Hub 3/2S 85\" and 556 kWh per year for\nSurface Hub 3/2S 50\".\n\nThe Production life cycle stage includes extraction of raw materials, upstream materials preparation,\nelectronic component manufacturing, subassembly manufacturing and assembly, and final assembly.\n\nCalculations are based on the US configuration of Surface Hub 2S with 85-inch display, Intel® Core™ is \nprocessor, 8 GB DRAM, and 128 GB SSD.

Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which \nincorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.\n\nThe information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average notebook computer with the specifications listed in\n\nManufacturingBreakout\n\nGHG Emissions\n\n![img-0-8](img-0-8)\n\nMainboard and other boards \nSolid State Drive (SSD) \nDisplay \nPower Supply Unit & External Cables \nChassis \nBatteries \nOthers*\n\nHP'senvironmentalimpactcalculationsaredoneinaccordancewithISO14040/44.Allestimatiesofimpactresultsareuncertain,resultinglargely fromdatalimitationsanddataquality.To mitigatethisuncertainty,HPhasdevelopedHP-specifictoolsthatuseaconbinationofHPprocessesand productdata,aswellashigh-qualitylifecycleassessmentdata.HPstrivestoprovidethemostaccurateenvironmentalimpactresultsbutuncertainty willneverscompletelyminimizedandresultsshouldbeconsideredaccordingly.\n\nLifetime of product (years) \nUse location \nUse energy demand (kWh/year) \nProduct weight (kg) \nScreen size (in) \nFinal manufacturing location\n\nAdditional product environmental performance\n\nAssumptions\n\nAdditional information about HP’s carbon footprinting program car\nbe found in HP’s yearly Sustainability Report, which is available on\nthe HP Sustainability website.\n\nThe site also contains IT Eco Declarations, which provide product-\nspecific environmental information, as well as information on HP’s \nproduct recycling programs.\n\nand all subassemblies packaging and transport\n\nLearn more at\n\nHP'sSustainabilityWebsite\n\nhp\n\n© Copyright 2021 HP Development Company, L.P.

If you need any other country specific information, please contact environment@ lenovo. com.\n\nNotes:\n\nLife cycle phases included in the streamlined Product Attribute to Impact Algorithm (PAIA) Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) can be grouped\ninto four categories which include Manufacture, Transport, Use, and End of Life. Below is a brief description of each phase.\n\nManufacture: This life cycle phase captures emissions generated during the extraction, production, and transport of raw materials, the \nmanufacture of components and subassemblies (including the product packaging) and product assembly.\n\nTransport: Emissions included in the transport phase include all those generated during the air, ocean or land transport of finished or semi-finished Lenovo products between Lenovo facilities and from Lenovo facilities to customers.\n\nUse: In use energy consumption is calculated in accordance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star® Typical \nEnergy Consumption (TEC) methodology. Calculated energy consumption is then used in combination with average emissions factors \nfor the designated country of use to calculate emissions.\n\nEnd of Life: It is assumed that a designated portion of the product (see table above) is recycled at the end of the use period determined\nin the TEC methodology. It is also assumed that the balance of the product waste materials is disposed of by landfill. Emissions\ngenerated during the mechanical destruction, separation and transport of end of life materials are included in the calculation.\n\nProduct  scope  of  this  sheet  includes  desktop  computer,  integrated  desktop  computer,  notebook  computer,  monitor  and  tablet. \nThis document is only valid in connection with “THE ECO DECLARATION” of the specific product.\n\nPage2of2",
