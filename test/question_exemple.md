OPTIMIZED CONFIGURATION (Q1 2024):

- Server consolidation (virtualization): -15% server count
- Dynamic power management: -25% idle power
- Upgraded cooling system (hot aisle containment): -30% cooling power
- LED lighting conversion: -60% lighting power
- New UPS efficiency (96% vs 94%): -10% UPS losses

=== CARBON IMPACT CALCULATIONS ===

Grid Carbon Intensity (California):
- Off-peak (23:00-06:00): 0.198 kg CO₂/kWh (35% renewable)
- Mid-peak (06:00-16:00): 0.267 kg CO₂/kWh (28% renewable)
- On-peak (16:00-23:00): 0.384 kg CO₂/kWh (18% renewable)
- Weighted average: 0.289 kg CO₂/kWh

ANNUAL CARBON EMISSIONS:

Baseline (2023): 31,536 MWh × 0.289 kg/kWh = 9,114 metric tons CO₂

Optimized (2024):
- Servers: (1,680 × 0.85 + 420 × 0.75) × 8,760h = 15,466 MWh
- Cooling: 900 × 0.70 × 8,760h = 5,519 MWh
- UPS: 180 × 0.90 × 8,760h = 1,419 MWh
- Lighting: 120 × 0.40 × 8,760h = 421 MWh
- Other unchanged: (180 + 120) × 8,760h = 2,628 MWh
- Total optimized: 25,453 MWh
- Carbon emissions: 25,453 × 0.289 = 7,356 metric tons CO₂

CARBON REDUCTION ACHIEVED:
→ Absolute reduction: 9,114 - 7,356 = 1,758 metric tons CO₂/year
→ Percentage reduction: 19.3%
→ Equivalent to removing 382 passenger cars from roads

=== FINANCIAL ANALYSIS ===

Electricity cost (blended rate): $0.145/kWh

Baseline annual cost: 31,536 MWh × $145/MWh = $4,572,720

Optimized annual cost: 25,453 MWh × $145/MWh = $3,690,685

Annual savings: $882,035


Optimization investment: $2,800,000

Payback period: 3.2 years

ROI over 10 years: 215%

=== FUTURE PROJECTIONS ===

With planned solar installation (2025):
- 15 MW solar array (capacity factor: 28%)
- Annual generation: 36,792 MWh
- Projected grid independence: 85%
- Additional carbon reduction: 5,247 metric tons CO₂/year
- Total carbon reduction vs 2023 baseline: 75.6%
